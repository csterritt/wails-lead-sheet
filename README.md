### About

This is a project to make an app which will allow processing of
lead-sheets, such as are copied from various music websites.

The goal is to have the code recognize section parts, chords,
and lyrics, and allow changing the key, or generating Nashville
numbers instead of chords. The output from this program will be
flat ascii, intended to be printed in a monospace font, in two
columns.
